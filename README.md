The code for the website is in all the files except read me.

On the homepage, there is a graph containing the data of various threatened species.

The names of species on the graph are their scientific names. Below the graph, there is a searchbar to find the scientific name of a species using its common name.

On the sidebar (top left arrow on mobile), you can select the "main analysis" page to see our analysis of various threatened species, including potential factors for their extinction.
